## ▶️ Usage
1. **Install OpenModel**  
   - Download the latest `OpenModel-Setup.exe` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/tan-qiao-guo/openmodel/releases) page. Install on Windows 10/11 (tested on 64-bit).  
2. **Open a Project File**  
   - Launch OpenModel and load `Metal bioaccumulation.OMMLx` or `TK_TD.OMMLx`.  
3. **Run the Simulation**  
   - Use the built-in simulation controls to reproduce model fitting as described in the manuscript.
